|Software | Description|
|---------|------------|
|Bioconductor: | bioconductor is an open source and open development software project for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data.|
|Blast: | basic local alignment search tool |
|Autodock: | suite of automated docking tools that is designed to predict how small molecules, such as substrates or drug candidates, bind to a receptor of known 3D structure |
|Bioperl: | collection of perl modules that facilitate the development of perl scripts for bioinformatics applications |
|BlastZ: | independent implementation of the gapped blast algorithm specifically designed for aligning two long genomic sequences |
|Definiens: | The Definiens Enterprise Image IntelligenceSuite is a comprehensive image analysis platform for two-dimensional (2D) image analysis. It contains all the client and server software needed to extract intelligence from any digital image in a fully-automated or semi-automated way. The client software is role-based and supports the needs and skills of different users in an organization. The server software, known as the Definiens eCognition® Server, is a processing environment that allows the batch processing of jobs. It is hugely scaleable, capable of handling millions of images in a single job. |
|Ensembl: | freely available software system for genomic analysis that cope well with rough draft data |
|Gromacs: | open-source molecular dynamics package|
|Imaris: | Imaris is Biplane’s core software module that delivers all the necessary functionality for visualization, segmentation and interpretation of 3D and 4D microscopy datasets. Combining speed, precision and ease-of-use, Imaris provides a complete set of features for working with three- and four-dimensional multi-channel images of any size, from a few megabytes to multiple gigabytes in size. Conveniently load, process and visualize images acquired from almost any confocal and wide field microscope to gain new and groundbreaking insight from your image data. |
|Matlab: | 	tool for doing numerical computations with matrices and vectors |
|MySQL | open-source database |
|pgSQL | open-source database |
|R | R is a open source software for statistical computing and graphics |
|S-Plus/Insightful Miner: | statistics software and data mining software |
