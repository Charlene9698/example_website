The BioInformatics Research Centre (BIRC) is a research centre under the School of Computer Engineering (SCE) at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). BIRC is the focus of the education, research and development, and human-resource training in bioinformatics at NTU. It brings together scientists and engineers, who are interested in bioinformatics modeling and computation, and fosters cross-disciplinary interactions among different schools at NTU to perform advanced research in bioinformatics. It also makes the necessary partnerships with other research and educational institutions, locally and abroad, to achieve its objectives.
The mission of BIRC is to provide the interdisciplinary environment and training for students and researchers to engage in leading and cutting edge research in bioinformatics, and thereby become a part of the life sciences workforce in Singapore and elsewhere.
BIRC also facilitates the teaching and research projects of the M.Sc. (Bioinformatics) offered by the School of Computer Engineering and Ph.D. (Computation and Systems Biology) offered by Singapore - MIT Alliance."
